What is Python, and why is it popular ?\n","\n"," ▶ Python is commonly used for developing websites and software, task automation, data analysis, and data visualisation. Since it's relatively easy to learn, Python has been adopted by many non-programmers, such as accountants and scientists, for a variety of everyday tasks, like organising finances.\n","\n"," ▶ Its user-friendly and intuitive nature, combined with rapid development capabilities and ease of learning, make it one of the world's most popular programming languages. Python's applications span across industries, powering technologies in web development, data science, artificial intelligence, finance, and more.\n","2. What is an interpreter in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ A Python Interpreter is a program that processes and executes Python code either from a script file or interactively, allowing programmers to test and run code line by line.\n","3. What are pre-defined keywords in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Keywords in Python are predefined reserved words with special meanings so the interpreter can understand them. They perform specific tasks in Python programming and are a part of its syntax.\n","4. Can keywords be used as variable names ?\n","\n"," ▶ Python keywords cannot be used as the names of variables, functions, and classes or any other identifier.\n","5. What is mutability in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ In Python, 'mutable' is the ability of objects to change their values. These are often the objects that store a collection of data.\n","6. Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable ?\n","\n"," ▶ Tuples and lists are the same in every way except two: tuples use parentheses instead of square brackets, and the items in tuples cannot be modified (but the items in lists can be modified). We often call lists mutable (meaning they can be changed) and tuples immutable (meaning they cannot be changed).\n","7. What is the difference between “==” and “is” operators in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ The 'is' is termed as the identity operator. The == operator is used to compare the equality of objects. The is operator is used to check if different variables are pointing to the same object in memory. The == operator is used in Python when the values of the operands are equal.\n","8. What are logical operators in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Python offers three logical operators: and, or, and not. These operators, also known as Boolean operators, evaluate multiple conditions and determine an expression's overall truth value.\n","9.  What is type casting in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Type Casting is the method to convert the Python variable datatype into a certain data type in order to perform the required operation by users.\n","10. What is the difference between implicit and explicit type casting\n","\n"," ▶ Implicit type casting happens automatically, while explicit type casting requires manual intervention.\n","11. What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python ?\n","\n"," ▶ Conditional statements are an essential part of programming in Python. They allow you to make decisions based on the values of variables or the result of comparisons.\n","12. How does the elif statement work ?\n","\n"," ▶ The “elif” keyword in Python, stands for “else if”. It can be used in conditional statements to check for multiple conditions. For example, if the first condition is false, it moves on to the next “elif” statement to check if that condition is true.\n","13. What is the difference between for and while loops\n","\n"," ▶ For loop is used to iterate over a sequence of items. While loop is used to repeatedly execute a block of statements while a condition is true. For loops are designed for iterating over a sequence of items.\n","14.  Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for loop.\n","\n"," ▶ A 'While Loop' is more appropriate when you need to iterate until a condition is met without knowing the number of iterations in advance. This makes it suitable for situations like processing user guesses for a secret number.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","Pratical questions :\n","\n","1.
